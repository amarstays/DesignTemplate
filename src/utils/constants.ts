    with an extremely discerning eye for colors and hues. After completing quite a few projects for her family
    & friends in Dehradun, her talent and skills brought her all the way to Bangalore. She then obtained an
    MBA in finance & marketing while continuing to do interior design projects on the side. But fundamentally
    hailing from a business family and the youngest among 4 daughters of an extremely self-reliant and self-
    made father, Sachii decided to strike it out on her own. Thus, came about the birth of Gruham Ti'Amore.`,
